# COVID-19 Andriod APP
These are some code I have done for an Andrioid App that make requests to a thrid party API which returns
the most up-to-date information about the COVID-19 cases in user-selected country.
The servlet and the API are both stored in Heroku and the log info is stored in my MangoDB database.
